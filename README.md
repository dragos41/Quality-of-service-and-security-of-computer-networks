# Quality-of-service-and-security-of-computer-networks

1. Create the test environment (Kali Linux + virtual machine running nmap and iperf)
2. Connectivity testing

 - this step includes configuring some services on the machine
including the use of secure connections (e.g.
HTTPS, SSL, SSH)

3. Bandwidth testing (iperf) - using iperf for testing
available bandwidth (both between the two machines used and between
and with an external server, both TCP and UDP)

4. Security testing (nmap) + firewall implementation - scanning with
nmap scanning of available ports and trying to find any
security issues, and then implementing firewall rules
to protect the ports
